# IanZyvithEmployeeTracker

## Goal
The goal of this project was to use our knowledge of Node.js, inquirer and MySQL in order to create a console application that connects to a database that holds tables of information on employees, roles and departments. The user can interact with the menu to look at each table of information as well as add and change those tables.
